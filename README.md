# DELTA-FUSION (aDaptive rEaL Time Analysis of big fusion data)

This project implements a client-server model for analysis of streaming data from
fusion experiments or large-scale simulations.

Implemented as part of "Adaptive near-real time net-worked analysis of big
fusion data", (FY18).


The current implementation features a data generator and a data processor.
Both are MPI applications. Each generator task reads data from a single group of channels
and writes them via the ADIOS2 dataman interface.
Each processor task reads this data and performs a single analysis routine.
The output of the analysis is stored in a database for later analysis and visualization.


To run the analysis framework run a generator and a processor simultaneously on a node:
```
srun -n 2 -c 2 --mem=1G --gres=craynetwork:0 python generator_adios2.py
srun -n 2 -c 2 --mem=1G --gres=craynetwork:0 python processor_adios2.py
```

For example within an interactive session, using a split terminal (see the screen utility)

# Workflow Scenario #1
It consists of three components:
```
  generator.py         =====>    receiver.py         =====>    analysis.py
(running on KSTAR DTN)   |   (running on NERSC DTN)    |     (running on NERSC compute nodes)
                         v                             v
    stream name: {shotnum}-{channelid}.bp          {shotnum}-{channelid}.s{rank}.bp
```

Example commands are as follows:
```
python generator.py --config config-kstar.json
python receiver.py --config config-nersc.json
srun -n 4 python -u analysis.py --config config-nersc.json
```

Parameters can be provided with a Jason file. Here is an example:
```
